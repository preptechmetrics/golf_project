Golf league scoring project
This project will provide calculations and analysis for golf league scoring. The data is derived from an actual active golf league. Golfers enter the following information weekly via a google form:  
    league play date, their team, opponent and hole by hole scores.
    
The google form generates results that are exported to a spreadsheet (.xlsx or .csv). That resulting spreadsheet with the raw data needed to be cleaned/adjusted for privacy.  When I created the google form, golfers and teams were entered based on player names.  I used operations/functions to change personal names in the raw data to team numbers and initials. Small sample dummy files are provided to demonstrate the process used on the actual raw data containing personal/identifiable data.

This was created using Google CoLab and can be opened by anyone using the link at top.
